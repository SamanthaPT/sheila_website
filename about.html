		<h4>Synopsis</h4>
	
		<p>My name is Sheila Silveira and I am currently studying my master's degree in Film and TV Production at Bournemouth University.</p>

		<p>I was born in Canada but I spent most of my life living in Pico Island, in the Azores. When I was 19 I moved to the mainland in Portugal to study my bachelor's degree in Documentary Cinema, but what I'm really 
		passionate about making is drama.</p>

		<p>In a Moment tells the story of a young girl from a small island who spreads her wings and goes out into the big world to discover herself and where she belongs. Itâ€™s an overwhelming experience for her and she finds 
		herself at a crossroads between her past, her present and her potential future.</p>

		<p>This is a story about decisions and the consequences that come from them, but above all it's about facing new challenges in an immense world full of possibilities.</p>

		<p>I have been meaning to bring this story to the screen for a long time. Now I am finishing my master's degree and I am surrounded by amazing, talented people that will help me make this film the very best it can: 
		there couldn't be a better opportunity than this one to make this dream come true.</p>
