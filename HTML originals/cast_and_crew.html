					Sophie’s first big debut was at the tender age of seven where she played ‘The Lion’ in Androcles and the Lion. This vital role required lots of psychological preparation 
					especially as her face was concealed by a mascot head for the duration of the performance. Fifteen years later, Sophie graduated from The Arts University Bournemouth with 
					a First Class BA Hons Degree in Acting. After graduating, Sophie toured the UK for seven months performing to over 25,000 young people about the dangers of alcohol abuse. 
					Since moving to London in January, Sophie has continued to pursue her acting career, appearing in short films and fringe performances. She is particularly fond of comedies
					and has enjoyed playing parts such as Belinda in Seasons Greetings and Adriana in The Comedy of Errors. She makes regular trips to the theatre and can often be found at 
					anything Shakespearian trying to sneak on stage in full costume.

					Born in Canada to an Azorean imigrant family, however at the age of 3 they decided to move back to the Azores, Pico Island. Her love for film started at a very early age, when she was 
					exposed to the Disney Films her family in Canada would send overseas. Living on a small island and not being exposed to many materialistic things, she held on to those films and imagined 
					herself being a part of those worlds one day, by creating her own worlds. It was when she started imagining the stories she wrote, on screen, that she noticed there was nothing else that 
					would give her as much joy than becoming a filmmaker. She decided to take a degree in Documentary Cinema which ended in 2013 at Escola Superior de Tecnologia de Abrantes, in Portugal. 
					However she discovered that she wanted to further explore the production side of filmmaking, and is currently studying a MA in Film and TV Production at Bournemouth University where she is 
					working on her first feature film as her masters project.
